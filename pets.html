            <p>Milo is a 6 year old schnoodle. He is super energetic and his favorite game is fetch, which he wants to
                play all the time — yes, even when it’s pitch black outside or the weather is unideal. Milo is also
                loving and kind, at least to humans. When he’s around other dogs, he is either jealous of the attention
                they’re receiving, or ignores them because he has other priorities (chasing a ball).</p>
            <p>Milo is also a pretty smart dog, although he doesn't always use it for good. He can roll over on command,
                and use his sense of scent to find a hidden treat. But he’s also figured out some loopholes to get what
                he wants. For example, he has been trained to nudge the bell near the front door to indicate that he
                needs to be walked. Recently, though, he’s learned that he can just pretend like he wants to go on a
                walk, but instead lead us around the house to the backyard so he can play. In case it wasn’t clear: Milo
                loves to play. Although he can be sneaky, my family loves him more than anything.</p>
